### 💻 Technologies Used:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building backend APIs.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for managing data.
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for user interface.
- **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens): Secure session management.
- **Nodemailer**: For sending email-based password recovery.
- **Bcrypt**: Password hashing for enhanced security.
- **OAuth2.0**: Authentication through social platforms (Google, Facebook).
- **OTP (One-Time Password)**: For additional login security.

### 🔑 Key Features:

- **🔐 Secure APIs**: Created secure APIs for user signup, login, and password recovery.
- **🗃 MongoDB**: Optimized database performance for reliable data management.
- **📧 Email-based Password Recovery**: Enabled email-based password recovery functionality via Nodemailer.
- **🔒 OAuth 2.0 Integration**: Added social login support via Google and Facebook for convenience and security.
- **⚡ Enhanced Security**:
    - **bcrypt** for password hashing.
    - **JWT** for token-based session management.
    - **OTP (One-Time Password)** for two-factor authentication during login.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface for seamless user experience across devices.

### 🔐 OTP Integration for Enhanced Security:
To ensure better protection, the OTP-based authentication system was integrated. During login attempts, an OTP is sent to the user's registered email, adding an extra layer of security before access is granted.
